# Business Problem
It is requested to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether individuals have diabetes or not when their features are provided. Before developing the model, it is expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps.
# Dataset Story
The dataset is a part of a large dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases in the United States. These data were collected from a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and above who live in Phoenix, the fifth largest city in Arizona. The target variable is indicated as "outcome," where 1 represents a positive result for the diabetes test and 0 represents a negative result.
